# FAQ

### **Age Restriction**

Please note: Festival participation from 18 years old.

### **Awareness Team**

Festivals and other cultural events offer spaces for hedonism and exuberance. They are meant to help balance and let go. They form important cultural and social spaces for, among others, people who are met with oppression and discrimination in everyday life every day. This makes it all the more important to make these spaces, which areparticularly worthy of protection, as safe as possible. We live in a world full of patriarchal power structures. It is our task to break up these structures and to counteract them  
decisively.

We want to create a space at Garbicz that is characterized by mutual respect and consensus. Let‘s create a world together in which we can all feel safe. The awareness structures of the Garbicz Festival are currently under construction. We are doing everything we can to make our spaces and yours less discriminatory. We will be at the festival with an awareness team and see ourselves as your friends, listeners and supporters.  
You can find us next to Eclipse and the Medics, next to the food court.

We are there for you if you need our help or support. We don‘t tolerate sexism, racism, rejectionism,  
queerphobia or any other form of discrimination at Garbicz.

### **Animals**

No animals allowed on Garbicz. We love your furry friends so much, but there is too much happening during the festival.

### **Arrival**

Your guide to getting to Garbicz Festival. We are located in the city of Garbicz, Poland.

**Take the Bassliner** 

We strongly recommend taking one of the bassliner busses from Berlin Ostbahnhof. No change of trains and tracks and arrive directly on site with a drink in hand. Booking is available through [**their website**](https://bassliner.org/en/tours/garbicz-festival-2024-2)[.](https://bassliner.org/) They usually add rides as bookings fill up, so don’t wait until the very end to catch your preferred slot. Journey takes approx. 2h in a perfect world, but be prepared for for potential border control checks, which can add to travel times. Again, Bassliner Tickets are NOT INCLUDED in your ticket this year, so no need to wait for [**the voucher**](https://bassliner.org/en/tours/garbicz-festival-2024-2) any day longer 🙂

**Camper Van Arrival**

Pass through Garbicz village for accreditation and receive your Camper Sticker, granting access to the festival site. Each sleeping vehicle requires one sticker; cars delivering wagons must park in our designated lot. Trust in our skilled traffic team and follow their instructions for a hassle-free experience. 

**Car Arrival** 

Secured parking is available throughout the festival and ticket is mandatory. Shuttles will go from car park to festival grounds 24/7. You can’t sleep in the car during the festival and you cannot leave your car anywhere else 🙂 Again, trust in our skilled traffic team and follow their instructions for a hassle-free experience. 

We have been in discussions with the fire department about electric cars. However, due to the ongoing drought and increased fire risk, we urge everyone to exercise caution and be vigilant.

The lack of specific regulations on this matter contributed to the length of our discussions, as we needed to ensure that all safety concerns were thoroughly addressed. We must prioritize guidance from the fire department before we can provide further information. Thank you for your attention and consideration.

**Train Arrival**

Arrive at Rzepin (Poland) and share a 30-euro taxi to the site. Check your preferred connections in advance and regularly. We recommend taking the bassliner bus (see above).

If you’re landing in Poland, Poznan Airport is the closest, located 149 km away (approximately 1:30 hours by car), but you’ll need to arrange your own transportation from there.

### **Lost & Found**

Lost & Found items @infopoint As festival organizers in Poland we have legal obligations. Below is a clear, step-by-step explanation of how this works for a festival or mass event in Poland:

 **1\. During the festival – Lost & Found @ Infopoint**  
 1\. We secure the items – Anything found should be kept in a safe place (often a designated Biuro Rzeczy Znalezionych – Lost and Found Office at the festival) which is located in our infopoint.  
 2\. We record the find  
 3\. We do our best to return lost items immediately. For example, if an ID card or wallet is found, we make every reasonable effort to locate the owner—through announcements, registration checks, or direct handover when possible.  
4\. Sensitive items – If we find personal documents, payment cards, or keys, we take extra care. Often, IDs and passports will be returned directly to the issuing authority or the police if the owner cannot be located.

 **2\. After the festival (items unclaimed)**  
 We are not allowed to transport any item to Berlin. According to Polish law (Kodeks cywilny, Ustawa o rzeczach znalezionych – The Act on Lost and Found Items of 2015). 

**2.1. Ordinary found property (clothing, electronics, bags):**  
We have to hand them over to the **starostwo powiatowe** (*county office*). Under the Polish Act on Found Items, after the festival ends unclaimed items must be handed over to the appropriate authorities:

**Ordinary items (clothing, electronics, etc.)**  
**Where to Hand It Over**: **Starostwo Powiatowe w Sulęcinie** (*county office*) – Lost Property Office: Lipowa 18, 69-200 Sulęcin, Poland

 **Valuable items** (over 100 PLN, cash, precious metals, weapons)  
 **Where to Hand It Over**: **Police station** (Any police station in Gmina Torzym or Sulęcin can accept items like documents, wallets with mowey, etc)

 **Documents (IDs, passports)**  
 **Where to Hand It Over**: **Police station** or issuing authority (e.g., *Urząd Miasta*). Adresse: Szpitalna 4, 69-200 Sulęcin, Poland

 **3\. How long are items kept?**  
The **starostwo** keeps items for **1 year** from the date of notification of the find. If no one claims them, we as a festival can request to take ownership (except for items that legally cannot be appropriated).
