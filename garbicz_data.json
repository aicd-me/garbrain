They form important cultural and social spaces for, among others, people who are met with oppression and discrimination in everyday life every day. This makes it all the more important to make these spaces, which are particularly worthy of protection, as safe as possible. We live in a world full of patriarchal power structures. It is our task to break up these structures and to counteract them decisively. We want to create a space at Garbicz Festival (Garbicz) that is characterized by mutual respect and consensus. Let's create a world together in which we can all feel safe. The awareness structures of the Garbicz Festival (Garbicz) Festival (Garbicz Festival (Garbicz)) are currently under construction. We are doing everything we can to make our spaces and yours less discriminatory. We will be at the festival with an awareness team and see ourselves as your friends, listeners and supporters.

This foundational aspect is essential for embodying an honest, vulnerable, and powerful manhood that transcends outdated concepts of masculinity. Discover how authentic presence serves as the bedrock for a creative and responsible life, fostering healing in your relationships with yourself, other men, women, and everyone around you. Embracing your true self may also involve a playful curiosity and a certain sense of queerness that balances both masculine and feminine qualities or challenges old interpretations of it. In the intensity of life's challenges, only a present man can cultivate the trust and capacity to stand firm, remain free, and be emotionally available. This workshop offers inspiring experiences and practical tools to help you embark on this path of self-discovery, growth and a truly supportive community.\n\n## Alchemy: Rewire Immersion\n**Day:** Friday  \n**Time:** 14:00  \n**Location:** Amphitheater  \n**Facilitator:** Rodo Escalante  \n**Description:** This 90-minute group session is designed for those already familiar with the foundational principles of Alchemy:Rewire and ready to go deeper together. Led by founder Rodo Escalante, this collective immersion invites you into a powerful group experience that sharpens focus, expands emotional resilience, and deepens nervous system regulation. Through a carefully calibrated sequence of intentional ventilations and strategic breath holds, we'll co-regulate in real time, tapping into the intelligence of the autonomic nervous system and training the mind-body system to remain calm and clear, even under internal or external pressure. Expect a potent reset for the vagus nerve, a recalibration of your neurochemistry, and a profound entry into states of brain-heart coherence. This isn't about learning the technique; it's about embodying it. Come prepared to move beyond the basics and into a collective state of heightened presence and performance.\n\n## Biohacking with Supplements\n**Day:** Friday  \n**Time:** 16:00  \n**Location:** Amphitheater  \n**Facilitator:** Nils Behrens  \n**Description:** \n\n## Hormone Balance & Perimenopause Hacks\n**Day:** Friday  \n**Time:** 18:00  \n**Location:** Amphitheater  \n**Facilitator:** Greta Namboutin  \n**Description:** Menopause isn't a quiet retreat – it's a bold invitation. To clarity, to fire, to yourself. If you dare to feel yourself anew, you'll discover a whole new freedom.\n\n## Echoes of Shiva (Kirtan)\n**Day:** Friday  \n**Time:** 20:00  \n**Location:** Amphitheater  \n**Facilitator:** Norema Pauw  \n**Description:** Cosmic Echoes of Shiva is a powerful voice journey of liberation, dissolving illusions and transcending the ego. Through our voices we open the heart; through devotion we free the mind and through rhythm we awaken the body. Chanting Shiva ignites the fire of transformation, inviting us to be in the vastness of existence. A ecstatic chant flow to expand and merge with the infinite.\n\n## Pyramid Party\n**Day:** Friday  \n**Time:** 22:00  \n**Location:** Amphitheater  \n**Facilitator:** Ben Okamoto  \n**Description:** What does it mean to let our deepest desires become our art? How do we embody the raw essence of life—love, connection, chaos, and celebration—through movement, music, and ritual? Pyramid Party - A Collective Dance-floor & Kundalini Experience. Building on last year's Rainbow Temple journey, we continue the story with tribal drumming, movement, and ritual. I would love to invite a drummer to perform and hold space with us. The performance will transition into an open dancefloor experience, blending organic rhythms with electronic beats for a deep, immersive journey. This is a ritual of sound and movement, bringing ravers into deeper connection with themselves and each other.\n\n---",

Rooted in ancient traditions, this experience harnesses the vibrational power of OM, the primordial sound, to create a transcendental energy field—one that transcends language and connects participants in a deep, resonant state. Together, the group will chant OM 108 times, a sacred number in many spiritual traditions, symbolizing wholeness, completion, and cosmic alignment. As voices merge into a unified frequency, the space transforms into a portal of sound where all boundaries dissolve. The repetition of OM is not merely a chant but a ritual of attunement, aligning each participant with the pulse of the collective and the healing frequency to spread across the entire festival.\n\n## Spiritual Theater\n**Day:** Sunday  \n**Time:** 18:00  \n**Location:** Amphitheater  \n**Facilitator:** Javid Wunsch  \n**Description:** This workshop invites you to connect with yourself and others through movement, improvisation, and role exploration.

Gigantic oaks and birch trees, some over 500 years old, have witnessed the past and are patiently awaiting the future. Their colossal roots spread out like veins, holding the sandy soil while canopies shelter generations to come.\n\nThese oaks, the green Gods of nature, were the first we saw here in Poland. We arrived in Garbicz Festival (Garbicz), dragged by an irresistible pull, with an unmistakable feeling that something greater brought us here. They called us and invited us to gather near the village, be welcomed like family and respectfully share what life gives. This we are truly grateful for.\n\nThe tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies\n\nLet these trees guide and protect us, let diversity make our community stronger.\n\nCome with us to Garbicz Festival (Garbicz), embrace nature and keep the spirit alive.",

Our multicultural community co-exists in harmony, built to uplift and endure in our own special corner of wilderness.\n\nOur goal is simple yet profound: respect and create with nature. The woods, the grass, the lake and every soul we encounter are intrinsic parts of our journey’s rhythm.\n\nAs we immerse ourselves in this beautiful land, every eye-to-eye connection reinforces our mantra: “Alles ist Gut.”\n\nEmbracing the “Oops” moments forms the core of our learning and creative process. These instances push us to break old patterns, explore new, heart-centered paths with conviction, and continually refine our craft for the better.\n\nGarbicz Festival (Garbicz) is where hedonism meets altruism. By treating ourselves, others, and nature with respect, we indulge in the simplest and purest pleasures life offers: connection, discovery, laughter, creation, contribution, and shared experiences are amongst our cherished treasures.\n\nThis synergy of caring and pleasure fuels an atmosphere filled with light and compassion. We strive to educate, promote peace, whilst opposing discrimination, to provide a barrier-free and supportive environment for all.\n\nYou are all, of course, welcome to join us.\n\nHere, we are: Garbicz Festival (Garbicz) Festival (Garbicz Festival (Garbicz)).",
