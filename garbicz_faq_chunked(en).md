    "topic": "Awareness Team",
    "content": "Festivals and other cultural events offer spaces for hedonism and exuberance. They are meant to help balance and let go. They form important cultural and social spaces for, among others, people who are met with oppression and discrimination in everyday life every day. This makes it all the more important to make these spaces, which are particularly worthy of protection, as safe as possible. We live in a world full of patriarchal power structures. It is our task to break up these structures and to counteract them decisively. We want to create a space at Garbicz that is characterized by mutual respect and consensus. Let's create a world together in which we can all feel safe. The awareness structures of the Garbicz Festival are currently under construction. We are doing everything we can to make our spaces and yours less discriminatory. We will be at the festival with an awareness team and see ourselves as your friends, listeners and supporters. You can find us next to Eclipse and the Medics, next to the food court. We are there for you if you need our help or support. We don't tolerate sexism, racism, rejectionism, queerphobia or any other form of discrimination at Garbicz."

Booking is available through their website. They usually add rides as bookings fill up, so don't wait until the very end to catch your preferred slot. Journey takes approx. 2h in a perfect world, but be prepared for potential border control checks, which can add to travel times. Bassliner Tickets are NOT INCLUDED in your ticket this year."

We have been in discussions with the fire department about electric cars. However, due to the ongoing drought and increased fire risk, we urge everyone to exercise caution and be vigilant. The lack of specific regulations on this matter contributed to the length of our discussions, as we needed to ensure that all safety concerns were thoroughly addressed. We must prioritize guidance from the fire department before we can provide further information."

Festival pre-top-up is highly recommended to skip the lines! If you purchased a festival pre-top-up on our website, simply show the QR code at accreditation during check-in. If your chip isn't working or you've lost your wristband, visit the Infopoint where our troubleshooting team can block the old one and transfer your remaining balance to a new wristband. Keep your wristband for refund after the festival."
