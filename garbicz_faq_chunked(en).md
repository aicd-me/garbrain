### Safety & Security

## Awareness Team
**Topic:** Awareness Team  
**Content:** Festivals and other cultural events offer spaces for hedonism and exuberance. They are meant to help balance and let go. They form important cultural and social spaces for, among others, people who are met with oppression and discrimination in everyday life every day. This makes it all the more important to make these spaces, which are particularly worthy of protection, as safe as possible. We live in a world full of patriarchal power structures. It is our task to break up these structures and to counteract them decisively. We want to create a space at Garbicz Festival (Garbicz) that is characterized by mutual respect and consensus. Let's create a world together in which we can all feel safe. The awareness structures of the Garbicz Festival (Garbicz) Festival (Garbicz Festival (Garbicz)) are currently under construction. We are doing everything we can to make our spaces and yours less discriminatory. We will be at the festival with an awareness team and see ourselves as your friends, listeners and supporters. You can find us next to Eclipse and the Medical Team (Medics), next to the food court. We are there for you if you need our help or support. We don't tolerate sexism, racism, rejectionism, queerphobia or any other form of discrimination at Garbicz Festival (Garbicz).

## First Aid
**Topic:** First Aid  
**Content:** We have Polish, English, and German-speaking Medical Team (Medics) on site, supported by the experienced team from Eclipse. They are equipped to assist in critical situations.
